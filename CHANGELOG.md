# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Maintained from 0.11.0 onward; earlier entries list release dates only (see git history).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`hierarchical` is now O(n²) instead of O(n³)** (all bindings). The merge
  phase rescanned every active pair each step, so on normal dataset sizes it
  froze the calling thread — ~1.4 s at n=2000, ~7.5 s at n=3000, ~12.5 s at
  n=4000 — blocking the browser main thread (an effective DoS on ordinary
  input). Replaced the naive min-scan with the nearest-neighbor-chain algorithm
  (valid for all supported reducible linkages: single/complete/average/Ward);
  measured n=4000 drops from ~12.5 s to ~66 ms (~190×), with clean O(n²)
  scaling. Output is unchanged for inputs in general position (verified against
  a brute-force reference across every linkage); for tied distances the `merges`
  array *ordering* may differ, but the tree and flat labels are equivalent.

### Added

- **`max_points` memory guard for `hierarchical`.** Because the O(n²) rewrite
  makes time cheap, the O(n²) distance matrix is now the binding constraint;
  inputs larger than `max_points` are rejected with a clear error (stating the
  count, the limit, and the estimated matrix size) before allocating. Exposed in
  the WASM config (`max_points?: number`); defaults to `10000` (≈400 MB matrix),
  `0` disables it. C-FFI callers get the default guard (no ABI change).

## [0.12.2] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- npm: expose the `./package.json` subpath in the `exports` map so tools
  that `require('<pkg>/package.json')` (license scanners, version
  reporters) keep working alongside the conditional exports introduced in
  the previous release (`ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **npm packaging — Node-compatible entry.** The npm package previously
  shipped only the wasm-bindgen *bundler*-target output, whose static
  `.wasm` import fails on Node's CJS path (`tsx`/`ts-node` in non-ESM
  packages) with an opaque `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`.
  The package now additionally ships the *nodejs*-target CJS glue under
  `node/` and routes Node consumers to it via a conditional `exports`
  map (`node` → CJS with filesystem wasm loading, `default` → bundler
  ESM). `require()`, native ESM `import`, and CJS TS runners all work
  without loader hooks. A pre-publish smoke test (CJS `require` + ESM
  `import`) now guards this path in CI. Rust API unchanged.

### Changed

- `u-numflow` dependency `^0.2` → `^0.3` (compatible; 0.3.0 publishes the
  previously-unreleased `wasm` feature and input-validation hardening —
  no API used by this crate changed).


## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed — BREAKING (WASM)

- WASM config/input objects (`dbscan`, `hierarchical`, `isolation_forest`,
  `lof`, `distribution_analysis`, `regression`, `feature_importance`,
  `detect_univariate_outliers`) now **reject unknown keys** with an explicit
  `unknown field` error instead of silently ignoring them
  (`serde(deny_unknown_fields)`). This is the guard for the defect class where
  a config typo (e.g. `fit` instead of `fit_distributions`) silently disabled
  a feature. Column-major *data* maps (`describe`, `correlation_matrix`,
  `predictors`/`features` values) are unaffected — column names stay free-form.

### Changed

- Dependency: `u-analytics` `^0.5` → `^0.6`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- WASM `distribution_analysis` config gains optional `bins` (integer >= 1):
  explicit histogram bin count. When set it takes precedence over
  `bin_method`, and the histogram `method` field echoes `"Fixed(n)"`.
- Core: `distribution::BinMethod::Fixed(usize)` (mirrors u-analytics 0.5.0).

### Changed

- Dependency: `u-analytics` `^0.4` → `^0.5`.
- Adding a variant to the public `BinMethod` enum breaks exhaustive `match`
  expressions in Rust consumers (WASM/FFI consumers unaffected).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- WASM: dropped legacy `*_json` parameter-name suffixes from 16 exported
  functions — they take native JS objects/arrays, and JSON-string arguments
  are now rejected early with a descriptive error. C header (FFI) unchanged.
